# Evidente 2.0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci`
Runs a clean install of all needed modules

### `npm run evidente`
Make sure that all needed modules are installed before running the app. <br />
Runs the app and the server in the background.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Examples

### Toy Example
Toy example with 38 taxa and 10 SNPs. The phylogenetic tree is a modified version of the one presented by Yokoyama et al (2008, [Publicataion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768804)). The SNPs are based on the table of the _Mycobacterim leprae_ by Schuenemann et al (2018, [Publication](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006997)). Hence, this example does not show any biological data, but it can still be used to get to know the GUI of Evidente. 

### Mini Example
Extract of the Toy Example with seven taxa. This example is used to initialize Evidente. 

### _Mycobacterium leprae_
From Schuenemann et al (2018, [Publication](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006997)). The study analyzed over 169 taxa of different species around the globe and identified 3155 SNPs. It provides a metadata file with the location and date of extraction of the samples. 

### _Treponema pallidum_
From Arora et al (2016, [Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016245)). The study analyzed around 120 samples of different strains of the _T. pallidum_ collected around the globe. It analyzed their antibiotic resistance and it was able to identified a correlation between the presence of SNP 235204 and a resistance to the antibiotic macrolide.
